# Mobile Flashcards

This project is a flashcard application for Android mobile devices in which users may create collections of flashcards and quiz themselves on the decks that they create. I created the application using `react-native` along with `redux`.

## Downloading The Project

* To download, you can clone the repository using this terminal command:
```
git clone https://github.com/wbchristerson/MobileFlashcards.git
```

Alternatively, follow the instructions below to download to a hard drive:
* Click the green "Clone or download" button above then choose "Download ZIP".
* Find the folder `MobileFlashcards-master` in your Downloads folder or wherever it was placed on your device.
* Right click and choose "Extract All".

* To install all dependencies from the command line, run the following command in the terminal within the project folder:
    - `npm install`
* In another terminal window, run the following command to start the project
    - `npm start`

The terminal will then provide you with several options. If you have the application [Expo](https://expo.io/) on your device, then you can scan the accompanying QR code that appears, which will then give you the option to run the application on mobile (note: the scan is most easily executed on terminals with a black background and a gray or white foreground).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

For complete details about running react-native applications such as this one on mobile devices, see [here](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/README.md).
